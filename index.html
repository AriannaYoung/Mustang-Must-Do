      <p> <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/storageengine/punched-cards-control-jacquard-loom/">1.	1801: In Lyon, a Frenchman named Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a device called the power loom. He had the idea for the loom in earlier years, but they got cut off by the French revolution. Once he was able to put his ideas together and create this machine, he was rewarded.  This machine could weave based on a certain pattern, which it reads off of a punched wooden card that is held together by rope. Silk was what they weaved together. Since these machines were such a hit, it put many other loom operators out of work which brought lots of hate towards Jacquard. This weavers were so infuriated that they attacked Jacquard and burned his machines. After a while they were finally accepted and Jacquard was once again rewarded, with a gold medal and the Cross of the Legion. By the 1820s, the loom spread to England and eventually went worldwide</a></p>

        <p> <a href="http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/article040101.html">1936:The idea of a computer’s memory being controlled by a program of coding was brought up by a guy named Alan Turing. Known as the ‘universal computing machine’ Turing’s Universal Turing machine has unlimited memory. It contains scanners that move through the memory looking symbol by symbol trying read what it finds. Entering different programs in the memory causes the machine to carry many different computations. This machine is overall really great because it is just a single machine made out of many different fixed structures which can change itself in a way that makes it go from doing one task to another. Turing’s goal was to show everyone how much his machine could accomplish. Turing's concept was revolutionary. </a></p>

        <p> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1223shockley-bardeen-brattain-transistor/">1947: The transistor, or also known as the point contact transistor was called one the most important invention the 20th century. This device is a semiconductor device that can switch or amplify electrical signals. The development was made to replace vacuum tubes. Vacuum tubes were such a big problem, so a lot of research was done to find an alternative. This research was done by AT&T’s development-and-research arm, Bell Lab. Shockley, a physicist at Bell Labs, worked on a theory of the device for nearly a decade before the first transistor was developed. Shockley couldn’t seem to build a working model. Working together with different colleagues and trying new experiments resulted in a working project, but when it was presented Shockley was not present and was said to have been bitter about it.</a></p>

        <p> <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/microsoft-history-of-a-computing-giant-1991140">1975: Before they co-founded Microsoft, Paul Allen and Bill Gates were computer geeks. They liked to spend their time on computers as much as possible, even at school. When they were caught hacking into the school’s computer, instead of being punished, they were asked to help improve the school’s computers performance. After that they ran their own small business, called Traf-O-Data. After high school, Gates got accepted into Harvard, but ended up dropping out to continue to work with Allen. In January of 1975, Allen read an article in a magazine called Popular Electronics. It had an, article, about the Altair 88oo, microcomputer, and he showed it to Gates, and they offered to write a version of the new BASIC programming language for MITS, the makers of Altair. After eight weeks of working, they presented their work to MITS, and they agreed to distribute their work. This inspired Gates and Allen to create their own company, Microsoft.</a></p>

        <p> <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/2000/">2000: This year brought a lot of advancements to the technology world. For example, the USB flash drive was introduced.  Otherwise known as memory or jump drives, these little devices carry flash memory. They are used for storing memory and/or transferring or backing up files between devices. Anther very important advancement is the camera phone. Today, phones with cameras are very, very important, so when the J-Phone J-SH04 was introduced, the line quickly expanded. Within a year, cameras became a significant part of most phone. The PlayStation 2 introduced. This device could be used as a gaming system and DVD player because you could use it to watch your movies on DVD. This was very important to people because the game system was cheaper than a regular DVD player. After selling more 150,000,000 systems, this system was named one of the most successful game systems ever released. In the future these developments will continue to be made better and better causing devices to become increasingly important in the world today.</a></p>
